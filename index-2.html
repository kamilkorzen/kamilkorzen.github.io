      <p2><br>on a daily basis I work with advanced statistics, predictive modeling, causality and A/B Testing. For modelling purposes, I use standard econometric models such as Linear and Logistic Regression, Probit, Tobit or Time Series Models, and for more complex tasks I use unsupervised learning methods such as PCA, kMeans, DBSCAN, UMAP or t-SNE or supervised machine learning like kNN, SVM, Decision Tree Models, Random Forest, XGBoost, Keras or NLP Models. I am capable of writing high-quality code in SQL and Spark as well as in R and Python, being fluent in top 5-10 most popular libraries</p2>
